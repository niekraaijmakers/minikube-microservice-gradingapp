# Default Deny All Traffic
# ========================
# This NetworkPolicy blocks ALL ingress and egress traffic by default.
# Other policies will then explicitly allow specific traffic flows.
#
# This is a security best practice: deny by default, allow explicitly.
#
# IMPORTANT: Without this policy, all traffic is allowed!
# With this policy, only traffic explicitly allowed by other policies will work.
