# External Services Namespace
# ===========================
# This namespace simulates "external" services that are outside our application.
# In the real world, these would be third-party services like:
#   - Email providers (SendGrid, Mailgun)
#   - Notification services (Slack, Teams)
#   - Payment processors (Stripe)
#   - External databases
#
# By putting the webhook-receiver in a DIFFERENT namespace, we can demonstrate
# egress NetworkPolicies controlling cross-namespace communication.
